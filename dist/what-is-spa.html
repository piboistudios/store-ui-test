    <h1>What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application#:~:text=A%20single%2Dpage%20application%20(SPA,browser%20loading%20entire%20new%20pages.">SPA</a>?</h1>
    <div>
        <p>A SPA is a Single Page Application. It is exactly what the name implies.</p>
        <p>As modern web design has come a long way, so also has JavaScript; it is now possible (or much more feasible) to package the functionality of an entire web application spanning many pages into one page, and have a reactive JavaScript library update
            the page in realtime.</p>
        <p><strong>Who cares?</strong></p>
        <p>Well, you care, because if the entire website loads at once, this means you don't have to wait for page reloads.</p>
        <p>Notice in the <a href="/views/products?page=1">Crappy Server Pages</a> every time you click on a button on the pagination component, it reloads the page. But in the <a href="/spa.html">SPA</a> version, changing pages does not cause a page reload.
            That is the standard practice for updating a server page (or at least, most server page frameworks are designed in such a way that the simplest way to update a page is reloading it entirely). In a SPA, the page stays the same and just responds
            to data it receives from the web server (rather than receiving entire web pages from the web server)</p>
        <p>Whenever you hear "
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a>" or "<a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>" or even "
            <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>", they're talking about modern JS Frameworks used to create SPAs.</p>
        <p>Whenever you hear "jQuery" they're probably talking about server pages (jQuery actually offers no added functionality in 2021; vanillaJS with the advent of <code>querySelectorAll</code> basically does everything jQuery does... except it doesn't
            use a stupid
            <code>$</code> API, and it has ES6 Promises)</p>
