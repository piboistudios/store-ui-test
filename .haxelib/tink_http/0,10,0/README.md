[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/haxetink/public) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haxetink/tink_http.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haxetink/tink_http)

Tink HTTP provides a cross platform abstraction over the server and client side of HTTP, based on asynchronous immutable streams. Its API is an attempt to expose the protocol as directly as possible. While it can be used directly, it is meant as an abstraction layer to build frameworks on.
